It seems like you've received a message about resource usage on a node in a Kubernetes cluster. Let me break it down for you:

- **The node was low on resources: ephemeral-storage**: This means that the node in your Kubernetes cluster is running low on ephemeral storage, which is temporary storage available to containers running on the node.

- **Threshold quantity**: The threshold quantity is the maximum amount of ephemeral storage allowed on the node before it's considered low on resources. In your case, it's 1610486720 (which might be in bytes).

- **Available**: This indicates the amount of ephemeral storage currently available on the node. In your case, it's 949338 ki (kibibytes).

- **Container usage**: The container named `authcomsumercontainer-authawsperf` is using a significant amount of ephemeral storage, specifically 71733 Mi (megabytes).

- **Request**: The request for ephemeral storage by the container is listed as 0, which means the container didn't explicitly request any ephemeral storage.

- **Large consumption**: The message indicates that the container `authcomsumercontainer-authawsperf` is consuming a large amount of ephemeral storage, which is likely contributing to the node running low on resources.

To address this issue, you may need to investigate why the container is using such a large amount of ephemeral storage and consider optimizing its usage or allocating more resources to the node if necessary.
